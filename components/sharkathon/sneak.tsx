    question: `A famous Technology economics magazine in India, widely available across bookstores and airports across India, did two surveys. The findings were:
Findings from subscribers survey: Thirty per cent of all orders placed by subscribers in response to ads placed in the magazine last year were placed by subscribers under the age of thirty-five.
Findings from advertiser surveys: Most of the orders placed in response to advertisements in the magazine last year were placed by people under the age of thirty-five.
For both of the findings to be accurate, which of the following must be true?`,

      "3. Most orders placed in response to advertisements in the magazine last year were placed by subscribers over the age of thirty-five",
      "4. Last year, the average revenue per order placed was less for subscribers under age thirty-five than for those aged thirty-five or over",

    question: `The management of a famous restaurant in North East Delhi gave the following information to its CEO:
"Our revenues in North East Delhi declined by 10,000 consumers during the year. This is likely entirely due to the launch of a food delivery service in the area that, in addition to delivering both tasty and cheap food made by its cooks in central locations (cloud kitchens) targeting the student population living in the area, also delivered food from neighbourhood restaurants to people's homes for a fee. We should tie up with it."
The CEO was not convinced. He said "I know from some reliable sources that the cloud kitchens of the food delivery company prepared dishes for only 4,000 orders. Yet our fall was 10,000 consumers. There are other bigger reasons why our sales have declined. We should not do a tie-up."
Which of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the CEO's argument:`,
    options: [
      "A. Three restaurants shut down in North East Delhi during the year",
      "B. During the year, the food delivery company did more deliveries for neighbourhood restaurants than its cloud kitchen orders",
      "C. 70% of restaurants in the area offer discounts of 25% during non-peak hours on food orders",
      "D. People generally order 3 dishes per order in a restaurant and 2.5 dishes while ordering for home delivery",
      "E. For 2 months, there was road construction work happening just outside the entrance to the restaurant, making entry more difficult.",

    question: `During the harvest season, grain is being brought into an empty warehouse constantly every day through trucks. At the same time, it releases a certain constant quantity of grain to milling factories across the region for making flour. Unless grain is stored in the warehouse, it will get spoiled in the next rain. 400 metric tonnes of grain are waiting for storage in the warehouse. How long will it take for the warehouse to get filled? Two statements are provided:
I. The total capacity of grain the warehouse can hold is 120 metric tonnes
II. The trucks bringing grains can completely fill the empty warehouse in 10 days if there are no outward deliveries to milling factories. The trucks carrying grain for milling can completely empty a filled warehouse in 15 days if there are no fresh inward supplies of grains.`,
    options: [
      "1. Statement I alone is sufficient but statement II alone is not sufficient to answer the question asked.",
      "2. Statement II alone is sufficient but statement I alone is not sufficient to answer the question asked.",
      "3. Both statements I and II together are sufficient to answer the question but neither statement is sufficient alone",
      "4. Each statement alone is sufficient to answer the question",
      "5. Statements I and II are not sufficient to answer the question asked and additional data is needed to answer the statements",

    question: `An entrepreneur shows the following data. He is looking for funding of INR 2 crore, at a valuation of INR 10 Crore for the
company. Should you invest?
Year 0: Revenue INR 1 Cr. Loss INR 2 crores
Year 1: Revenue INR 3 Cr. Loss INR 1 Cr
Year 2: Revenue INR 6 Cr: Profit INR 5 lakhs
Year 3 (Current year): Revenue INR 8 Cr: Profit INR 10 lakhs
The team is expected to come up with and ask a set of questions, get more data, and then form an opinion about the
business, including whether the valuation is justified or not, and finally take a decision and create a small presentation on
the reason for its decision. There is no right or wrong answer, but the depth of thinking and communication will decide
the scoring.
For example, the initial questions in this case could be:
On business: Industry, promoter experience, funding taken so far
On profitability and growth: Projections for the next 3 years
On valuation metrics: TAM, SAM, SOM, Industry multiples, etc
On risks and capabilities: Team, attritions if any, legal cases, consumer complaints, etc
On financials: Metrics like debtors, inventory, ROCE, etc,`,
